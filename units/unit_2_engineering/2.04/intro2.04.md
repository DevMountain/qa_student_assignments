# DM Labs: UI Automation

Now you should be ready to look a little deeper into the application your
organization REALLY wants you to test. The lead developer for your team gives
you a link to a new repository to clone. He walks you through the code,
explaining **Server/Client Architecture**, and how **Web Applications** work in
particular:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Data Binding**
- **The DOM**
- And how to watch all of this using **DevTools**

Walking you through the code, he shows you the **Stack** your team uses, and
tells you about your automation stack, which will leverage Typescript and Jest
(which you’ve already worked with) as well as **Selenium Webdriver**. Given a
small set of incomplete tests, you’ve been challenged to complete them with the
assertions you’re already familiar with, and see if you can spot some of the
biggest **Benefits of Automation**.
