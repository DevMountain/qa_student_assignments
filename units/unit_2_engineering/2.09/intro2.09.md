# DM Labs: API Testing

Now that you’re really on your way to effective test automation with Selenium,
**API Testing** is the next skillset to learn! Your Lead explains that there are
several different **Types of APIs**, but your organization chiefly uses a Rest
API that handles **HTTP Requests**.

You’re taught the **Structure** of an HTTP Request including

- **Types of Requests**
  - **Get**
  - **Post**
  - **Other**
- **Parameters**
- **Headers**
- **Body**

You’ll get to try a few different tools for this testing, but the first one
you’ll try is **Postman**, which handles **Parameters**, **Collections**,
**Environments**, and even full **Tests**, which you can export and run in
**Newman**.
