## Summary

This activity is all about the initial plan. You need to identify two main
things.

- What web site/app will you test?
- How will you test it?

---

## Choosing a Web Application

You want to make sure that your group selects a good application to test.

| Requirement            | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Must be an application | The site that you pick must be an application; not a static page. In other words, the site needs to have functionality, not only be a display piece.                                                                              |
| Sufficient content     | The site needs to have enough pieces of functionality to justify your group work. This could mean lightly touching a LOT of functionality, or doing a deeper dive on a smaller subset, but really simple pages should be avoided. |
| Professional content   | The site you choose needs to be the sort that you could demo to a hiring manager; you want it to be something that showcases your skills. It should not detract with exceptionally bad design, or NSFW content.                   |

If you are thinking of multiple pages that meet those criteria, decide on which
one might be most fun, or that the majority of your group wants to test. You
should be able to have fun with this.

### Verify with Instruction Team

One your team knows what you'd like to pick, run it past a member of the
instruction team before proceeding to verify that you will be able to move
ahead. The instruction team can and will veto web sites/applications that they
feel do not meet these stated requirements, or might have other suggestions.

---

## Draft Your Test Plan

1. Create a Test Plan
   - In Jira, you should create your test plan in your assigned Project. Follow
     up with your instruction team if you do not have access.
1. Determine Features to be Tested
   - List out the individual features/pieces of functionality you plan to test.
   - Prioritizing these can be helpful.
   - Smaller pieces are individually much easier to accomplish.
1. Document Features not to be Tested
   - If you _know_ you won't test something, list it, and your reasoning.
1. Outline Testing
   - Having an idea of how you will test each area of functionality is quite
     helpful.
   - Test cases can be good, even if you're just defining placeholders for now;
     they can keep your automation on track.

---

## Outline a To Do List

With a loose test plan, you should determine the tasks that need to be done to
accomplish your testing. These tasks can and probably should be tracked in Jira
as tasks that can eventually be assigned to your team members.

The following tasks will probably exist in every project; note that some of
these bullet points would represent multiple tasks:

- Create a GitHub repository and invite team members to collaborate
- Create required page objects
  - With appropriate selectors
  - With abstracted functionality
- Check for API requests that can be reproduced in Postman
- Plan ahead for iterable tests
  - Determine needed test data

Right now you shouldn't worry about being too accurate/granular; we're after big
picture items. If you can easily identify when an item should be broken into
smaller tasks, feel free, but focus more on getting all the tasks created vs
grooming them perfectly.

---

## Submission

Using Canvas, submit a link to your Jira Board for our initial review.

---

## Up Next

Your next task will be to go back through your plan and to do list asking the
following questions:

1. Did you hit the points you needed to?
1. Do you need to break down any tasks?
1. Do we know the order things need to be done in?
1. Who should do which pieces?
