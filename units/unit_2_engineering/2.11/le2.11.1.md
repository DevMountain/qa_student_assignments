# Report on Tool Tutorial Outcomes

#### Target Time +/- 75 minutes

## Summary

You should get some practice following a tutorial for a new tool now, while you
have access to a bit more support.

---

## Step 1 - Pick a Tool

You should already have spent a few minutes earlier today thinking of tools you
wanted to try an why. Either pick one of those, or quickly decide on a new tool
you want to try out.

---

## Step 2 - Pick a Tutorial

1. Search for a "getting started" tutorial for that tool.
   - Don't just settle on the first option.
   - Can you find one from the creators of the tool?
   - Do you get a good number of options?

> Often the tutorial FROM the maker of the tool can be great. Sometimes though,
> it isn't written well for people starting from scratch.

2. Skim the tutorials you've found.
   - Does one seem like it will be easier to follow than the others?
3. Settle on one to try.

---

## Step 3 - Follow the Tutorial

Follow the tutorial you found; not for too long, but enough to at least get
things started.

- If you hit road blocks, maybe try one of the other tutorials you found.

---

## Step 4 - Answer Questions

In your favorite text editor, answer the following questions with at least a few
sentences each. Your answers will be your submission against the assignment.

> 1. Were you able to get the tool working? Why/Why not?
> 1. What challenges did you run into with the tool or tutorial?
> 1. Did you need to do additional research or use more than one tutorial? If
>    so, why, and how did it go?
> 1. Do you still like the tool and will you continue on learning it? Why/Why
>    not?

---

## Submission

Submit your answers to the questions above, either by copy/paste, or
uploading/linking a document.

---

## Stretch Goal

Try teaching a peer how to use the tool.

- See if it goes better than just giving them the tutorial.
- Keep track of questions that come up, especially those that you don't know the
  answer to and have to research yourself.
