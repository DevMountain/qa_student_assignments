## Summary

Your **Group Capstone** for this course is to select a web page/application
which you will work together to create and automate testing. The goal is to show
effective test automation design and execution, as well as good collaboration
skills.

You will be required to work in a group, where all members are judged
individually -- meaning that you will not be penalized for someone dropping the
ball, or rewarded for someone else doing all of your work.

The groups will be assigned, but the application to test will NOT be assigned.

The process of your assignment is broken out into several phases as shown, and
then below that, you can see the rubric that will be used to grade your Group
Capstone.

## Phases

### 1. Preliminary Planning

As a group you will need to do a few things.

1. Determine what web site/app you will be testing.
1. Outline a test plan; test cases are optional, but recommended.
1. Break the plan down into smaller tasks that can be tracked in Jira.

### 2. Plan Review

Once again, you will get together with your group before starting more
individual work.

1. Review your plan with fresh eyes.
   1. Do any tasks need to be broken down into smaller tasks?
   1. Do you know where the dependencies are between tasks?
1. Assign out the tasks.
   1. If you realize you've planned for more than you are likely to accomplish,
      that's fine. Work can be prioritized to make sure the key deliveries are
      completed first.

### 3. Setup

Spend some time getting your group set up as contributors to the same GitHub
repository with the basic skeleton of your automation in place.

### 4. Iterations

Your group should be regularly discussing the work:

- Completed assignments and pull requests
- Bugs found (both in the application, and in the tests)
- Next steps

### 5. Polish

This is a chance for your group to discuss any last minute additions to the
testing suite, and to make sure that all merged code is functioning as expected.

### 6. Retrospective

You will discuss together what went well, and what improvements could be made
next time you work on a similar project.

This is also when your group will put together a brief presentation about your
testing efforts.

### 7. Presentations

Your group will have an opportunity to present its results during the graduation
ceremony at the end of the course. While you need not all present, all members
of your group will be expected to be ready to answer questions.

## Submission

Most of your work will be submitted all at once; a link to your Jira Project.

Some work, like comments during the retrospective may be submitted separately,
but both Jira and GitHub will allow us to see your personal contributions to the
project.

## Rubric

You will need to hit an average of "Meets Expectations" across the categories
listed below. However, each category must have been at least attempted. Detailed
expectations for each requirement will be provided in upcoming documents.

> **Note:** The grading on this assignment will include technical evaluation,
> but will be far more weighted to reward effective processes and collaboration.

| Category             | Requirement        | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| QA Fundamentals      | Test Plan          | You must have submitted a good test plan, with thorough expectations set for what your automation will include, and your stretch goals.                                                          |
| QA Fundamentals      | Testing            | The tests you have automated should make sense and be effective tests in and of themselves.                                                                                                      |
| QA Fundamentals      | Soft Skills        | You must collaborate well with your teammates - good discussion, effective followthrough on your commitments, etc.                                                                               |
| Programming          | Collaboration      | Your group must work together on the same GitHub repository, effectively managing branches and pull requests to maintain clean code. You also need to have clear comments included in your code. |
| Programming          | Abstraction        | You must effectively leverage abstraction for functionality and shared data using things like Page Objects and data files.                                                                       |
| Effective Automation | Reliable Execution | Your automation should execute correctly on most computers/internet connections.                                                                                                                 |
| Effective Automation | Reliable Results   | Your tests should use assertions well (checking the "right" things) and should not produce false positives.                                                                                      |
| Effective Automation | Reliable Iteration | There need to be multiple examples of iteration in your automated testing; executing the same steps with different data should still provide accurate results.                                   |
| Other Tools          | API Testing        | Wherever possible, you should attempt to hit an application's API directly, reproducing calls you've found in the Network tab in Postman.                                                        |
