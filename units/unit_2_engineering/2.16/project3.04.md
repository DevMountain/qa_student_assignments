## Summary

You've been working on your project for a bit now. Getting together with your
peers and giving a quick summary of your efforts so far and plans going forward
is a great opportunity to polish your plan.

Go through the following steps for each member of your group.

> **Note:** There are three big soft skills points to consider.
>
> 1. It is important to be mindful of your peers as you go through this process.
>    There will be things that others might be doing more effectively than you
>    are, or you might see someone struggling with something that feels simple.
>    - Keep your feedback targeted to helping your peers improve, not helping
>      them to meet _your_ standards.
> 2. Please keep an eye on the time; don't spend so long on one project that you
>    lack the time to look at another.
> 3. Give this process your full attention. Do not continue working on your own
>    project when you should be reviewing your peer's.

## 1. Show Your Work

Take a few minutes to go through your project (or listen/watch your peer).

You _should_ be able to use your test plan to walk you through sharing each of
these points:

- Intro the web app you're testing.
- Show what features you'll be testing and why.
- Share how you're working to accomplish the testing.
- List any major concerns you have about completing your capstone.

If you're looking over your peer's project, take notes on things you do or do
not like about the app they're testing, their plan to test it, or their
automation.

---

## 2. Discuss

When discussing your application, be open to the feedback you receive from your
peers, and take lots of notes!

When reviewing a peer's capstone, keep an eye out for missed opportunities.

- Major functionality not tested
- Ways to make the testing easier
- Areas the plan seems a bit too weak

Leverage your softskills both giving AND receiving feedback!

---

## 3. Improve

Take the feedback you were given and consider it. Is there a suggestion you were
given, or a really cool feature of a peer's capstone, that you'd like to use?
More than one?

Update your test plan with any changes you're making based on this review
session.

---

## Submission

Submit a document, a google docs link, etc. with your notes from the review
session, specifically including what you're updating in your capstone based on:

- Feedback received and/or
- A great example from a peer

---

## Up Next

Now that you've had a chance to look over your project and your peers', and
update your plans, it's time to get back to work!
