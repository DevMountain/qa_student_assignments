## Summary

This is your last scheudled iteration on this project, and the steps have been
updated accordingly.

---

## Step 1 - Standup

Look things over in your standup with an eye to prioritizing the last few
required pieces. Polish is nice, but delivering on key pieces is better.

- Have you covered the key pieces of functionality for users?
- Are there any areas with _really_ flaky tests that could use your attention?
- When you look at the tasks, make sure that you're getting what you need done
  before what you want.

---

## Step 2 - Iterate!

Work towards finishing up your project now! Your
<a href="../2.12/project2.05.html" target="\_blank">First Iteration</a> has the
outline of the process of getting your code changes in place.

> **Note:** Pay extra attention here to making things clean. Clear comments,
> reliable results, etc.

## Submission

Using Canvas, submit a link to at least one of your pull requests.

---

## Up Next

Polishing this project up as a group will help make things a bit more cohesive
for your presentation, and also to have this as a portfolio piece.
