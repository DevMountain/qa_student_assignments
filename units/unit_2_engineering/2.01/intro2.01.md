# **DM Labs: Intro to Programming**

Your project manager lets you know that you’ve been able to catch the team up
for the most part, and way faster than expected. Time to skill up. You will be
trained in a few more technical skills, like automation, on the way to being a
QA Engineer. First is a crash course in **Programming**.

At your developer’s desk, they explain that you will need to be able to provide
Instructions knowing how **Computers** work, and how they will interpret your
instructions, working with:

- **File structures and navigation**
- Using the **Terminal/Command Line**
- Different programming **Languages**

For now, they shoot you an email with some code that you’re to copy and paste
into your **IDE**.

What you’ve been given is a loose setup to do **Unit Testing** using **Jest and
Typescript**. You’ll be spending most of the rest of your day experimenting with
**Assertions**. You get a quick explanation about **Data Types**, and
**Variables**, and a set of instructions to check out:

- **Strings**
- **Numbers**
- **Booleans**
