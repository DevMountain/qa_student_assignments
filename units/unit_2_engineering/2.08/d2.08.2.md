## Cheap or expensive? Estimating maintenance work.

Pick one of these tasks and guesstimate how hard it would be to do: you can use
your own scale, but explain what you mean and how you got to that point. You can
also use hours.

- Rewriting your first major automation project with what you know now.
- Rewriting your test cases from your fundamentals project to be easier to
  automate.
- Tweaking your last automation assignment to use page objects more effectively.

Consider if a large re-write was done to Employee Manager's employee list.

- How long would it take to update automation without page objects?
- How long owuld it take to update automation with a page object that had a
  "selectEmployee" method?
