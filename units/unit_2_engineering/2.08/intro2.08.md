# DM Labs: More on Collaboration

In preparation to have you contributing more to the team’s work, your Lead
describes some of the process of **Collaborating** on a shared project and code
base. You are to **Pull** down a different branch of your company’s product, and
**Merge** it into the code you’ve been working on.

One of the first things they show you is a **“Base” Page Class** that serves as
a foundation for much of the team’s efforts, using the programming principle
**Inheritance**.

There are a large number of failing tests on this project, but your Lead has
been consumed by another project, so it will be up to you to start **Maintaining
Automated Testing** for this product, and you’re given a list of things to start
working on:

- Saving **Screenshots** on failed tests
- **Reading/Writing Files** for test data
- Fixing and **Avoiding False Positives**
- Submitting a **Pull Request** to merge your changes into the repo’s Master
  branch
