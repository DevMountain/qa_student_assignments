## Summary

Reviewing the feedback you were given and notes you took as part of the review
process, you need to update your work!

---

## 1. Update your Test Plan

Take your test plan as it stands, and update it according to what you:

- Need to change
- Want to change

Feedback you were given on required changes should be prioritized, but take
action on the things you would like to update as well.

Make sure to leave notes/comments regarding why you are making these changes.

---

## 2. Reprioritize Tasks

- Do you need to drop what you're working on now to tackle required changes?
- Can you finish what you're about now, and then polish off any new tasks?
- Did you nail the required work and now you can really push yourself?

Whatever situation you find yourself in, make sure you know just what you need
to do before submitting your project. You will be submitting your work very
soon.

---

## Submission

Submit a summary (in your own words) of the changes you'll be making as you
complete your capstone project.

---

## Up Next

Time to work towards wrapping up your capstone!
