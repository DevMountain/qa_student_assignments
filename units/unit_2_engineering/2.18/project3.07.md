## Summary

This is an opportunity to meet 1:1 with a member of the instruction team. They
will provide feedback about your capstone as it stands, and be available to
answer questions.

---

## Be Prepared

You should have a rough idea of when your review will be. Be ready to:

- Discuss all points of your project
- How your work stacks up against the rubric you were provided
- Opportunities for improvement

---

## Ask Questions & Take Notes

As you are discussing your project, take notes on areas that need improvement,
as well as ideas to improve your work.

Make sure to ask any clarifying questions if you aren't 100% certain you know
what needs to be updated/fixed in your capstone.

---

## Submission

You will not need to submit any work for this particular task.

---

## Up Next

You should update your test plan according to the feedback you received,
prioritizing any rework you might need to do.
