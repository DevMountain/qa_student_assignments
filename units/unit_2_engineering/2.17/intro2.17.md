# DM Labs - DB Testing

Your team has brought in a guest speaker for a lunch and learn. The presenter is
a career DBA, or Database Administrator.

Their presentation is set to show you the ropes on how databases work,
especially **Relational Databases**. You'll learn some simple **SQL**, or
Structured Query Language, that's tailor made to get information out of
databases and tables.

This will prove very useful, as the goal of their presentation is to give you
and your teammates a headstart on **Database Testing** by using simple
**SELECT** statements to access the data inside the database.
