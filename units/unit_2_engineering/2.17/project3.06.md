## Summary

Continue to work on your test plan!

- Follow the same process you used in your
  <a target="\_blank" href="../2.15/project3.03.html">first iteration</a>.
- Feeling overwhelmed? Try coming at your project from a different angle; work
  on a different part for a little while!
  - You can also consider scaling back your overall plan; discuss major changes
    with your instruction team.
