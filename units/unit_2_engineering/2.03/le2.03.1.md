# Iterated Tests

#### Target Time Limit: +/- 90 minutes

Now it's time to really practice some iterative, or data driven, testing. We've
put together a repo that already has some functionality to test, and some sets
of data. Your assignment will be to complete the testing.

- See the requirements in GitHub, in the repository you need to fork and clone.

  - This assignment is the first in the README
- You will submit your code here in Canvas, as instructed in the repository.
