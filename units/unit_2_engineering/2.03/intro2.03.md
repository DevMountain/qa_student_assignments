# DM Labs: Data Driven Testing

Pleased with your progress, the developer you worked with yesterday is back
again to set you up for your next step towards full test automation - working
with a new data structure, **Lists**. With a list of similar items, you can
start looking at **Loops** and **Iteration**, or doing the same thing multiple
times, setting you up for **Data Driven Testing**.

Iterating through all of these similar things, she explains, is an example of
when **Classes & Objects** are useful; and she shows you how to set these up,
leveraging **Polymorphism**.

Todayâ€™s challenges are all around polymorphism and data driven testing:

- Stepping through a list of custom objects
- Using:
  - **Methods**
  - **Callback Functions**, named and **Anonymous**
