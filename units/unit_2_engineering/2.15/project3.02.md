## Summary

This activity is all about the initial plan. You need to identify two main
things.

- What web site/app will you test?
- How will you test it?

---

## Choosing a Web Application

You want to make sure that you select a good application to test.

| Requirement            | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Must be an application | The site that you pick must be an application; not a static page. In other words, the site needs to have functionality, not only be a display piece.                                                                        |
| Sufficient content     | The site needs to have enough pieces of functionality to justify your work. This could mean lightly touching a LOT of functionality, or doing a deeper dive on a smaller subset, but really simple pages should be avoided. |
| Professional content   | The site you choose needs to be the sort that you could demo to a hiring manager; you want it to be something that showcases your skills. It should not detract with exceptionally bad design, or NSFW content.             |

If you are thinking of multiple pages that meet those criteria, decide on which
one might be most fun. Hopefully code really is getting to be njoyable for you!.

### Verify with Instruction Team

One you know what you'd like to pick, run it past a member of the instruction
team before proceeding to verify that you will be able to move ahead. The
instruction team can and will veto web sites/applications that they feel do not
meet these stated requirements, or might have other suggestions.

## Draft Your Test Plan

1. Create a Test Plan
   - In Jira, you should create your test plan in your assigned Project. Follow
     up with your instruction team if you do not have access.
1. Determine Features to be Tested
   - List out the individual features/pieces of functionality you plan to test.
   - Prioritizing these can be helpful.
   - Smaller pieces are individually much easier to accomplish.
1. Document Features not to be Tested
   - If you _know_ you won't test something, list it, and your reasoning.
1. Outline Testing
   - Having an idea of how you will test each area of functionality is quite
     helpful.
   - Test cases can be good, even if you're just defining placeholders for now;
     they can keep your automation on track.

---

## Outline a To Do List

With a loose test plan, you should determine the tasks that need to be done to
accomplish your testing. These tasks can and probably should be tracked in Jira
as tasks that you can pick up and work on when it's time.

The following tasks will probably exist in every project; note that some of
these bullet points would represent multiple tasks:

- Create a public GitHub repository
- Create required page objects
  - With appropriate selectors
  - With abstracted functionality
- Check for API requests that can be reproduced in Postman
- Plan ahead for iterable tests
  - Determine needed test data

---

## Grooming

1. Take a small break and look back over your tasks.
   - Are you missing anything?
   - Do you need to break anything down?
1. Clean it up as you can! A lot of it will happen naturally as you go along.
1. Set priorities - you should always know what you have to work on next.
