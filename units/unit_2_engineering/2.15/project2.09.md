## Summary

Retrospectives are intended to help you learn from the positives and the
negatives; make sure this does not turn into a "witch hunt" or "blame game" -
but talk about how to make sure a similar project goes better next time.

---

## Step 1 - Test Summary Report

1. In Jira, go to your project's test plan, and in it's "Reporting" section,
   open up the "Testing Summary".
1. One team member should act as scribe, and probably share their screen.
   - If you're concerned about possibly using changes, you can write your report
     in another text editor and copy/paste it after.
1. Your report should have the following sections:
   1. What Went Well
   1. What Would We Change
   1. Testing Outcomes

With these sections, we can continue on.

---

## Step 2 - What Went Well

Start off with a positive focus. As a group, talk about the different things
that went well in your project.

- Technical stuff
- Soft skills stuff
- Challenges overcome
- Whatever

Anything that went well is fair game. Summarize what the group talked about in
th "What Went Well" section of your report.

---

## Step 3 - What Would We Change

This is far too often the main focus of the retrospective. It's important, but
be careful to bring things up in as positive a light as possible. Your focus
should be this:

- What things would you do differently if you were starting a similar project
  tomorrow?

As before, keep the discussion open, and summarize your talking points in the
report.

---

## Step 3 - Testing Outcomes

Treat this section like a standard Test Summary Report. Talk about how testing
went overall, what changes you had to make to your original plan and why, bugs
that you found and any thoughts about continuing testing or changing the product
you tested.

---

## Step 4 - `README.md` Lessons Learned

Have your scribe add a new section to your project's `README.md`:

- **Lessons Learned**

In this section add a few points from your retrospective, or new ideas that come
up putting this together. These points should tend towards:

- Tools/technologies used
- Processes followed
- etc.

After your doc is update, push it up to GitHub.

> **Highly Recommended:**
>
> 1. Make sure each group member has their own "Fork" of the project repository.
> 1. Make the project public; your GitHub is something of a portfolio for you,
>    and you want your future employers and peers to be able to see the project.

---

## Submission

You're done! Great work, all that's left is preparing for and sharing your
presentation at graduation, but it's time to submit your project.

In Canvas, submit a link to your test plan. We'll be able to get the rest from
there!

# Great work!
