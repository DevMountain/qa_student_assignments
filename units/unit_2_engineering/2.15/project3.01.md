## Summary

Your **Solo Capstone** for this course is to select a web page/application which
you will test via automation, where you run the whole show. The goal is to show
effective test automation design and execution on your own.

The process of your assignment is broken out into several phases as shown, and
then below that, you can see the rubric that will be used to grade your Solo
Capstone.

---

## Phases

### 1. Planning

You will need to do a few things.

1. Determine what web site/app you will be testing.
1. Outline a test plan; test cases are optional, but recommended.
1. Break the plan down into smaller tasks that can be tracked in Jira.

### 2. Setup

Spend some time getting your repository and basic pieces of the framework all
set up.

### 3. Iterations

Though you'll be working on your own, it will be good to follow similar
iteration patterns to group work:

- Use branches and pull requests to organize your own work.
- Look over completed tasks to make sure you hit all the requirements.
- Track bugs found (both in the application, and in the tests)
- Plan for next steps

### 4. Reviews

Both with groups and 1:1 with instruction team, reviews will offer opportunities
for another pair of eyes on the project, which we know to be valuable!

### 5. Rework & Polish

There will be time set aside to address concerns raised by the instruction team,
as well as a time specified to finalize and clean up the project.

### 6. Self-Retrospective

You will consider what went well, and what improvements could be made next time
you work on a similar project.

This will also be when you submit your project for grading.

### 7. Presentation Preparation

You will need to present your project to your peers at graduation, and this will
be when you prepare and submit your presentation.

### 8. Presentations

You will have an opportunity to present its results during the graduation
ceremony at the end of the course. You will also be expected to be ready to
answer questions.

## Submission

Most of your work will be submitted all at once; a link to your Jira Project.

Some work, like comments during the retrospective may be submitted separately,
but both Jira and GitHub will allow us to see your contributions to the project.

## Rubric

You will need to hit an average of "Meets Expectations" across the categories
listed below. However, each category must have been at least attempted. Detailed
expectations for each requirement will be provided in upcoming documents.

> **Note:** The grading on this assignment will include technical evaluation,
> but will be far more weighted to reward effective processes and collaboration.

| Category             | Requirement        | Summary                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| QA Fundamentals      | Test Plan          | You must have submitted a good test plan, with thorough expectations set for what your automation will include, and your stretch goals.                            |
| QA Fundamentals      | Testing            | The tests you have automated should make sense and be effective tests in and of themselves.                                                                        |
| QA Fundamentals      | Soft Skills        | You must show effective soft skills in your documentation: test plan, comments, test names, etc. All need to help make clearer what you are working to accomplish. |
| Programming          | Collaboration      | You need to show effective use of source management tools, even if you are working solo. You also need to have clear comments included in your code.               |
| Programming          | Abstraction        | You must effectively leverage abstraction for functionality and shared data using things like Page Objects and data files.                                         |
| Effective Automation | Reliable Execution | Your automation should execute correctly on most computers/internet connections.                                                                                   |
| Effective Automation | Reliable Results   | Your tests should use assertions well (checking the "right" things) and should not produce false positives.                                                        |
| Effective Automation | Reliable Iteration | There need to be multiple examples of iteration in your automated testing; executing the same steps with different data should still provide accurate results.     |
| Other Tools          | API Testing        | Wherever possible, you should attempt to hit an application's API directly, reproducing calls you've found in the Network tab in Postman.                          |
