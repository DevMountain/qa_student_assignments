## Summary

Your presentation is an important part of your capstones. It's great practice in
talking about your accomplishments and understanding of Quality Assurance,
particularly the technical automation skills you used for your project.

1. Review the presentation outline
1. See the format requirements
1. Prepare your presentation

> **Note:** If remote, your presentation video will need to be submitted at
> least a couple of days prior to graduation. See canvas for the specific
> submission deadline.

---

## Presentation Outline

Your audience will be those attending your graduation:

- Devmountaineers with a technical background
- Family and friends with a non-technical background

They should come away from your presentation thinking

> Wow, they did some really cool things with their code, and got a lot done!

You don't want them thinking

> Holy cow, QA has got to be the most boring and/or overly technical thing ever.

To accomplish this, try and stick to this rough outline:

1. Introduction
1. Show the App
1. Show your Tests
1. Biggest Challenges Overcome
1. Q&A

Your overall presentation should last **10-12 minutes**.

### 1. Introduction

#### _1-2 minutes, each team member_

Round-robin introductions of your team members (each team member introducing
themselves)

### 2. Show the App

#### _2-3 minutes, 1-2 team members_

Show your audience around the application. Highlight key **acceptance criteria**
or explain why some features were **not** tested.

### 3. Show your Tests

#### _3-5 minutes, 1-2 team members_

Show a portion of your tests running, and narrate what they are checking as they
do. Some code can be shown, but not too much.

- If code is shown, make sure it is clean and well structured.

### 4. Biggest Challenge(s) Overcome

#### _1-2 minutes, 1 team member_

What was the biggest obstacle you overcame, and how did you for this capstone?
This could be a problem with code, challenges collaborating, etc.

### 5. Q&A

There may be 1-2 questions from the MC about favorite parts of the project,
which part of the project you were most proud of, etc. You won't need to prepare
for this specifically ahead of time, just know it may happen.

---

## Format Requirements

### 1. Individual Contribution

Each team member should contribute to at least one major part of the
presentation BESIDES the quick self-introduction.

### 2. Slide Deck

Your presentation is best outlined by a slide deck. While each student should
outline their own contribution, this needs to be submitted as a single
presentation.

- Keep it professional.
  - Specific themes are up to you.
  - Specific tools are up to you - test them out ahead of time.
- Keep it concise.
  - Long enough to cover the subject, but short enough to be interesting.

### 3. Automation Execution

Code being executed should be pre-recorded. Automation may be finnicky the day
of, especially on a screen share.

- Use screencapture software.
- Embed the video of your test execution into your slide presentation.
- If the video is long, trim it down to show more of the different types of
  tests rather than showing the whole thing.

### 4. Content Sharing

Links are great, but can be hard to read/remember if they're too long.

- Include your GitHub usernames.
- Include the name of the repository.
- If you want to share your test plan, summary report, etc, export to PDF and
  include it in the GitHub repo.

---

## Giving the Presentation

How exactly the presentation is delivered will depend on whether your cohort is
in person or remote.

### In Person Delivery

As part of your graduation ceremony, your graduation MC will call your group
forward when it is your turn, and you will go through your presentation, hitting
each of the areas discussed above live.

- Test execution should still be pre-recorded and embedded into the slide deck.
- You will have one or two microphones to pass around your group.

### Remote Delivery

During your zoom graduation, your team will be presented. Due to more stringent
time limitations and possible issues with connectivity etc, you need to submit a
pre-recorded presentation.

- Get together with your group and record a screenshare of your presentation,
  with each of you narrating the appropriate sections as if you were presenting
  live.
- The video needs to be submitted a few days prior to graduation in order for
  your graduation MC to verify the video and have it queued up for presentation.
- See the Canvas due date for your cohort's submission deadline.
- The video should NOT be longer than 12 minutes.

## Submission

You can upload your presentation here in Canvas. If any files are too large,
feel free to submit a link or email the files to your instructor directly.
