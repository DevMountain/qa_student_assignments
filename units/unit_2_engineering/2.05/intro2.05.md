# Making Progress

Happy to see your progress, your Project Manager explains how there are multiple
**Types of Automation**; the unit testing you did before, and the UI automation
with Selenium, being only a couple of types. Before you deep dive into
automation and start streaming testing for your team moving forward, it’s time
to prove your skills.

You’re given a repository to fork and clone, which contains a little bit of
everything you’ve worked on this week. There are a number of **Comments**
throughout explaining what you’re to do, and instructions on **Committing** your
changes and **Pushing** them up to Github.

These skills, the PM explains, have prepared you well to pick up the most
popular test automation tool and really start to consider yourself a QA
Engineer.
