## Copying requests from DevTools

Spend a few minutes looking at different web sites. Post about the
best/coolest/most interesting request you were able to copy, or wish you could
copy.

- What makes this request so great?
- What challenges are you running into copying requests?
- Do you think that the request is secure enough or that it _shouldn't_ be so
  public?

To complete this lesson, post your reply below. Be sure to comment on the post

other peers other than the two posts you responded to.
