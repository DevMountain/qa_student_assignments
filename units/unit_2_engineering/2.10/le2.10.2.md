# Postman Collection - Copied Requests

#### Target Time +/- 90 minutes

## Summary

Copying requests from your network tab can be tough. It can be quite
enlightening though! You'll be doing so for TYJA and seeing what
patterns/concerning features you can uncover!

## Step 1

Create a new collection in Postman to hold TYJA queries.

## Step 2

Use TYJA with the network tab open.

- Copy the XHR requests that seem to pull in data into Postman.
- Save these requests to your collection.

## Step 3

Review the requests/responses; notice anything concerning?

- Some requests that I've made contain my plain text password!

## Submission

Save all queries that you're comfortable sharing (we won't make you share a
password) into the collection and submit your collection to Canvas.

## Stretch

Try this with other websites too!
