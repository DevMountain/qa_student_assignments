# DM Labs: Automating Manual Tests

Your QA Lead is back from vacation, and is shocked at your transformation; they
thought it would be quite a bit longer before you’d be ready to start
**Automating Manual Tests**, but it’s time to get you started.

Given an overview of the **Process of UI Automation**, your first challenge will
be figuring out Locators:

- **CSS**
- **Xpath**
- And assigning them to variables in your tests, like **Bys**.

Once you have a handle on these, you’re ready to start using classes to follow a
really popular testing **Model**, your Lead explains, the **Page Object Model**.
To start, you’ll be **Abstracting Locators** to your page object.
