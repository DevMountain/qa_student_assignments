# Architecting Projects

#### Target Time +/- 30 minutes

## Summary

You have been automating long enough that you should be able to set up your own
project now.

## Step 1

Create a new repository on
<a href="www.github.com" target="\blank">github.com</a> under your account, then
clone it to your machine.

## Step 2

Open your new repo, and copy in from your `qa_playground` the following files

- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `jest.config.js`
- `.gitignore`

## Step 3

Run the command `npm i`

## Step 4

Add two folders:

- `src`
  - `__tests__` (inside of `src`)

## Step 5

Try adding a test and running it from your `__tests__` folder!

You should be good to go!

## Stretch

Set your project up to have a `pageObjects` folder in the `__tests__` folder
that Jest will ignore by default.
