## Summary

Carry on! That's really what this iteration is about. Hopefully you've been able
to finish a task or two, and you're ready to pick up another.

---

## Step 1 - Standup

Get together with your team and discuss the state of your project.

- Are there things that need to change?
- Prioritization adjustments, additional tasks?
- Is it a good time for some pair programming?
- Do you or your peers need help with any particular issues?

Make sure everyone knows what they're going to be doing this iteration.

---

## Step 2 - Iterate!

Keep on keeping on; follow the outline you used for the
<a href="../2.12/project2.05.html" target="\_blank">First Iteration</a>, and
work towards getting more automation in place!

---

## Submission

Using Canvas, submit a link to at least one of your pull requests.

---

## Up Next

Your next iteration will be much the same, but should have a focus on starting
to wrap things up.
