# Functions to pass TDD Tests

#### Target Time Limit: +/- 60 minutes

We've done a bit of test writing to facilitate test driven development. This
time, we have a github respository for you to fork and clone that HAS tests, but
needs you to complete the function.

- See the requirements in GitHub, in the repository you need to fork and clone.
  - [qa_tdd](https://github.com/DevMountain/qa_tdd)
  - This assignment is the first in the README
- You will submit your code here in Canvas, as instructed in the repository.
