# Intro 2.02

Another dev from your team messages you to give her a link to your repository so
she can look over your code. When she realizes you don’t know what she means she
comes to your desk to explain the theory of **Configuration Management** and
**Version Control**, along with the specifics of **Git and Github**, and how to
at least **Fork and Clone repositories**. You’ll use this to get started with a
bit more coding!

- You’ve already utilized **Abstraction** with your variables
- Now you’ll abstract out sets of instructions into _Functions_ \* She explains
  that **Null/Undefined** errors are a symptom of problems in your arguments and
  returns, something to keep an eye out for!

Your challenges for the day are a bit more complicated, so she shows you how to
write your unit tests BEFORE you tackle the challenge to set your own finish
line; this is called **Test Driven Development**. It’s a good thing too, since
your challenges are based around **Logic Structures**, AKA decision statements:

- **If / Else**
- **Switch**
