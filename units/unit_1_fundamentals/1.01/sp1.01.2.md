# Document Review

## Skills Practice Summary

You have been given access to the project documentation for **Employee Manager
v1.0**. Your task is to review the docs ahead of a meeting with the product
owner where you'll be able to ask questions. Try and come up with a few good
questions NOW that will give you more information and make your testing more
effective.

## Setup

Open the
<a target="_blank" href="https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.0_README.html">documentation</a>.

## Step 1

Read through, reviewing the requirements for this version of the application, as
well as upcoming documentation.

Take notes on the questions you have; and consider these questions as you go:

- What _should_ be tested?
- Where do you need more information before you can test effectively?
- Are there things you should be working ahead on?

- Are there any requirements for the fields themselves? Other than the future
  updates to phone number validation or required fields?
- "Modern Browser" is vague, does it inclue mobile testing?
