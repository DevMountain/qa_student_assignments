# Hands on Testing

## Skills Practice Summary

As part of getting to know the product a bit better, your task is to follow the
instructions given in two tests you will find in your Devmountain Labs project
on Jira. You will find that these tests are done in a different style from each
other:

- Promote Dollie Berry
- Delete Phillip Weaver

## Setup

1. Open [Jira](https://dmutah.atlassian.net)
1. Navigate to your Devmountain Labs project.
   - i.e. `QAJ Devmountain Labs`.
1. The tests mentioned will be "Test Case" issues with a "To Do" status in your
   project.
1. Make sure the tests open, and that you can follow their links to **Employee
   Manager v1.0**.

## Step 1

Follow the instructions to "Promote Dollie Berry".

- Did the test work as expected?
- Take notes on anything that seemed out of place in the software.

## Step 2

Repeat **Step 1** for "Delete Phillip Weaver".

## Step 3

Consider the following questions:

- Which style of test did you like better?
- Were there things in either test that you think _should_ have been covered,
  which were not?

## Solution

<details> <summary> Some notes to consider... </summary>
Though there really isn't a solution to practice like this, some things you probably should consider:
* As it stands, "Promote Dollie Berry" *technically* passes, but there are problems.
* "Delete Phillip Weaver" definitely would fail as a test.
* You may have noticed that the first test was far looser than the second, which leads to both positive and negative consequences.
