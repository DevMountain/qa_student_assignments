## **DM Labs: Welcome To Training**

Welcome to your new job at Devmountain Labs, a consulting software development
organization. You have been hired as their newest **Software QA Analyst**,
congratulations!

Devmountain Labs has several teams in their development department, and you will
be assigned to a dev team as its primary QA with the support of a Lead QA
throughout your training.

**[Alex](../../../personas/Alex.html)**, your Lead QA sits down and talks over
the requirements of your role with you. They have the
[job description](../../../assets/job_descriptions.html "example job descriptions")
printed out for you to look over, but sums it up pretty simply.

### QA Analyst Responsibilities

- Support your development team throughout the **Software Development
  Lifecycle** to produce high quality deliverables.
- **Increase Confidence** by using the **QA Process** as a whole and **Testing**
  specifically.
- **Champion the User** by representing their mindset and looking out for their
  needs and desires throughout the process.

To get your feet wet, and help you learn about the software you'll be
supporting, Alex explains the basics of **Functional Testing**, specifically
**Exploratory Testing**. Since the last QA left the company your team has been
doing their best, but there are probably a decent number of issues for you to
find.

With **Official Documentation** in hand, it's time to get out there and start
testing.
