# Report a Bug

## Skills Practice Summary

Now that you have a test plan, and at least one test, it's time to look for
bugs, and report at least one!

## Setup

- Have the application open:
  <a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.1_Version/index.html">Employee
  Manager v1.1</a>
- You can use your test from
  <a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_student_assignments/units/unit_1_fundamentals/1.02/sp1.02.2.html">Skills
  Practice 2.2</a>, or the solution test cases provided there.

<details  markdown="1"> <summary> Solution Test Cases </summary>

See the "solution" test cases in your Devmountain Labs project:

- Title starts with **\*Solution\***
- Issue type **Test Case**
- Status **Done**

</details>

## Step 1

Execute one or more tests, until you have found at least one bug.

## Step 2

In Jira, the same way you created a test case, you need to create a bug.

- Click the "Create" button in the upper navigation bar.
- Make sure the project selected is your Devmountain Labs project.
- The issue type should be "bug".

Remember, the most important fields are:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected results
- Actual results

Other supporting data is helpful, but not as important as those three.

## Stretch

- Do thorough testing
- Use some session based testing if you want to instead of the test case(s)
  you've made
- Make some guesses as to the root cause and include these in your bug report(s)

## Solution

You have an example bug in your project.

- Title starts with **\*Solution\***
- Its status is **Done**
- Issue type is **Bug**

## **_Good work!_**
