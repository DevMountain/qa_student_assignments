## Setup

1. Review your Test Executions created in Jira for
   <a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_student_assignments/units/unit_1_fundamentals/1.02/le1.02.2.html">Test
   Cases (LE 1.02.2)</a>.
   - Each failed execution will need to be further covered by a bug report.
2. Create any needed bug reports following the steps listed below.
   - You _may_ have some failed tests that can be covered by one bug report
     together instead of a report each. Use your judgement.

## Step 1

1. Create a new issue in Jira with the type **Bug**.
1. Complete any needed fields.
   - Remember, screenshots or any other supporting information is helpful to
     developers.

## Step 2

1. Review each Bug, to verify that:
   - Your explanations are clear enough.
   - You have enough supporting information for your developers to reproduce the
     problem.
   - You don't have TOO many issues listed in ONE bug.
1. Make sure to leave the bug in the **Backlog** issue status.
