# Bug Reports

#### Target Time Limit: +/- 30 minutes

## Summary

You have executed your tests, and presumably found at least a few problems! It's
time to document them for your developers to fix.

<details  markdown="1"> <summary> <strong> For Your Review </strong> </summary>

If you're feeling uncertain on where to start in this project, look over the
following:

- Skills Practice:
  - [Complete a Test Plan](./sp1.02.1.html)
  - [Write a Test](./sp1.02.2.html)
  - [Report a Bug](./sp1.02.3.html)

</details>

## Setup

1. Review your Test Executions created in Jira for
   [Test Cases (LE 1.02.2)](./le1.02.2.html).
   - Each failed execution will need to be further covered by a bug report.
2. Create any needed bug reports following the steps listed below.
   - You _may_ have some failed tests that can be covered by one bug report
     together instead of a report each. Use your judgement.

## Step 1

1. Create a new issue in Jira with the type **Bug**.
1. Complete any needed fields.
   - Remember, screenshots or any other supporting information is helpful to
     developers.

## Step 2

1. Review each Bug, to verify that:
   - Your explanations are clear enough.
   - You have enough supporting information for your developers to reproduce the
     problem.
   - You don't have TOO many issues listed in ONE bug.
1. Make sure to leave the bug in the **Backlog** issue status.

## Submit

Simply mark this assignment complete in Canvas. We will find it based upon the
test plan submitted earlier.

## Stretch

Using the same application selected in your test plan stretch, write up your bug
reports!
