# Test Cases

#### Target Time Limit: +/- 60 minutes

## Summary

You've roughed out a test plan at this point. Now it's time to create test cases
to cover the features to be tested. And execute them!

<details  markdown="1"> <summary> <strong> For Your Review </strong> </summary>

If you're feeling uncertain on where to start in this project, look over the
following:

- Skills Practice:
  - [Complete a Test Plan](./sp1.02.1.html)
  - [Write a Test](./sp1.02.2.html)
  - [Report a Bug](./sp1.02.3.html)

</details>

## Setup

1. Review your plan created in Jira for
   [Test Plan (LE 1.02.1)](./le1.02.1.html).
1. Repeat Steps 1-2 for each of the features to be tested.

## Step 1

- Determine if you will need one or more tests to cover this feature.
- You only need to create tests for features that have _already_ been developed.
  - Developer tasks are only complete if they are **Ready for Testing**.

## Step 2

1. Create the appropiate tests, keeping to the following criteria:
   - Use a descriptive "Summary" as the title of the test.
   - You do _not_ need to fill out every field of every test, though there needs
     to be enough to go on for each that you can fairly quickly assess each
     feature.
   - Be brief for now. You don't need much detail.
2. As you complete each test, update its Jira Status to **Done**.

## Step 3

- Cross check your tests against the features to be tested in your plan to make
  sure you have enough coverage to make a rough assessment of quality.

## Step 4

1. Open the app [Flashcards](https://devmountain.github.io/qa_flashcards/),
   and...
1. Execute each test! Take only brief notes on any problems found.
1. Add a "Test Execution" subtask calle "Initial Test", and mark its Jira Status
   as **Passed** or **Failed**.

## Submit

Simply mark this assignment complete in Canvas. We will find it based upon the
test plan submitted earlier.
