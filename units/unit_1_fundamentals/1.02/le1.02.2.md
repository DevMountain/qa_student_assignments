#### Target Time Limit: +/- 60 minutes

## Summary

You've roughed out a test plan at this point. Now it's time to create test cases
to cover the features to be tested. And execute them!

## Setup

1. Review your plan created in Jira for
   <a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_student_assignments/units/unit_1_fundamentals/1.02/le1.02.1.html">Test
   Plan (LE 1.02.1)</a>.
1. Repeat Steps 1-2 for each of the features to be tested.

## Step 1

- Determine if you will need one or more tests to cover this feature.
- You only need to create tests for features that have _already_ been developed.
  - Developer tasks are only complete if they are **Ready for Testing**.

## Step 2

1. Create the appropiate tests, keeping to the following criteria:
   - Use a descriptive "Summary" as the title of the test.
   - You do _not_ need to fill out every field of every test, though there needs
     to be enough to go on for each that you can fairly quickly assess each
     feature.
   - Be brief for now. You don't need much detail.
2. As you complete each test, update its Jira Status to **Done**.

## Step 3

- Cross check your tests against the features to be tested in your plan to make
  sure you have enough coverage to make a rough assessment of quality.

## Step 4

1. Open the app
   <a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_flashcards/">Flashcards</a>,
   and...
1. Execute each test! Take only brief notes on any problems found.
1. Add a "Test Execution" subtask calle "Initial Test", and mark its Jira Status
   as **Passed** or **Failed**.

## Submit
