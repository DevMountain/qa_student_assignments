# Test Plan

#### Target Time Limit: +/- 30 minutes

## Summary

You have been given access to a simple application, and some developer tasks
that serve as documentation in Jira. Your project for sub-unit 1.02 will be to
complete Test Products for it, starting with a Test Plan.

<details  markdown="1"> <summary> <strong> For Your Review </strong> </summary>

If you're feeling uncertain on where to start in this project, look over the
following:

- Skills Practice:
  - [Complete a Test Plan](./sp1.02.1.html)
  - [Write a Test](./sp1.02.2.html)
  - [Report a Bug](./sp1.02.3.html)

</details>

## Step 1

1. Find the project "{your key} Flashcards" in Jira.
1. Look over the tasks that are "Ready for Testing".
   - You don't need access to the test environment right now, so don't worry
     about that.
1. Take a briefer look at the other tasks.

## Step 2

1. Create a Test Plan in that same project in Jira.
1. Complete the different sections of the plan in brief.
   - Leave the **Testing Summary** in the **Reporting** section blank for now.
1. When complete, update the Jira Status of test plan to **Done**.

## Stretch

Following these same steps a number of times can help to solidify the thought
process, even if you won't always write up a test plan in the industry.

Choose an application, web, mobile, desktop, any of the above, and create
yourself a new project in Jira to practice with.
