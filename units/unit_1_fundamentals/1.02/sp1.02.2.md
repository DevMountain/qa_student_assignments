# Write a Test

## Skills Practice Summary

Now that you have a solid test plan in place, you're ready to start putting
together some test cases. At least one.

## Setup

- Have either your completed test plan from
  <a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_student_assignments/units/unit_1_fundamentals/1.02/sp1.02.1.html">Skills
  Practice 2.1</a>, or the solution test plan, on hand.
- Employee Manager v1.1 is available
  <a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.1_Version/index.html">here</a>
- Be in <a target="\_blank" href="https://dmutah.atlassian.net">Jira</a>, in
  your Devmountain Labs project.

## Step 1

From your test plan, choose one of the features to be tested. Identify one or
more test criteria for that feature, if none are listed. Start thinking about
how you would:

- Prove the feature works
- Prove the feature is broken

## Step 2

Create a new Test Case in Jira by clicking the "Create" button in the upper
navigation bar.

- The project selected in the dropdown should be your Devmountain Labs project.
- The issue type should "Test Case"
- To click the "Create" button and save the new test case, you need at minimum a
  "Summary" -- this field functions as the title of the Jira issue.

## Step 3

Complete the test case by either filling out the fields you want to before
saving it, or by clicking into and editing the fields in the issue view page.

- You **don't** need to fill out every field for a valid test case. Feel free to
  wing it, experiment!

## Stretch Goal

Create tests for each feature to be tested; try making some broader, some
narrower in focus. Finding the style that works best for you will make manual
testing easier, more efficient, and less likely to bore you to tears.

## Solution

<details  markdown="1"> <summary> Test Cases </summary>

See the "solution" test cases in your Devmountain Labs project:

- \*Solution\* Swapping Records Mid-Edit
- \*Solution\* Edit Name

Keep in mind, these are only examples of what a completed test might look like,
not the perfect ideal. They have their own problems, just like the test cases in
Skills Practice 1.1.
