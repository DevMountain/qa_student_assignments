# Complete a Test Plan

## Skills Practice Summary

You have a better idea now what you should be working on, having worked with
your customers, _and_ you have the fresh work your development team has
completed.

## Setup

- Open the
  [Employee Manager v1.1 Docs](https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.1_README.html)
- Find the **Employee Manager Test Plan** in your Devmountain Labs project in
  [Jira](https://dmutah.atlassian.net/)
  - It has the title **Employee Manager Test Plan**
    - **NOT** titled **\*SOLUTION\* Employee Manager Test Plan**
  - Its issue type is **Test Plan**
  - It has the status **To Do**

## Step 1

Review the requirements in the new v1.1 documentation. Take note of the **Change
Log** in particular.

## Step 2

Fill out the incomplete sections in the partially completed test plan you have
in your Devmountain Labs project. Focus on content > format; it doesn't need to
be perfect right now, it's more important to get used to thinking through the
process.

- **Requirements**
  - Environment
  - Staffing
- **Testing Breakdown**
  - Features To Be Tested
  - Features Excluded From Testing
  - Other Supporting Info
- **Reporting**
  - Testing Summary

## Solution

<details> <summary> Solution Test Plan: </summary>

- Find the **Employee Manager Test Plan** in your Devmountain Labs project in
  [Jira](https://dmutah.atlassian.net/)
  - It has the title **\*SOLUTION\* Employee Manager Test Plan**
    - **NOT** titled **Employee Manager Test Plan**
  - Its issue type is **Test Plan**
  - It has the status **Done**

**NOTE:** This "solution" test plan still is not perfect. For example, it does
not include specific test criteria for the features to be tested.
