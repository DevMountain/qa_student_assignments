# Test Summary Report

#### Target Time Limit: +/- 30 minutes

## Summary

You're done testing; now it's time to summarize your findings.

<details> <summary> <strong> For Your Review </strong> </summary>

If you're feeling uncertain on where to start in this project, look over the
following:

- Skills Practice:
  - [Complete a Test Plan](./sp1.02.1.md)
  - [Write a Test](./sp1.02.2.md)
  - [Report a Bug](./sp1.02.3.md)

</details>

## Step 1

- Review what you planned to test in your test plan.
  - [Test Plan (LE 1.02.1)](./le1.02.1.md)
- Review what you _did_ test via your test cases.
  - [Test Cases (LE 1.02.2)](./le1.02.2.md)
- Look over the problems you found, described in your bug reports.
  - [Bug Reports (LE 1.02.3)](./le1.02.3.md)

## Step 2

In your test plan, fill out the **Testing Summary** in the **Reporting**
section.

- Summarize any major bugs or roadblocks.
- Provide your honest assessment as to the overall quality of the application.
  - Do you consider it ready for delivery to a customer?

**Note**: You will not need to directly submit this exercise, only mark it done.
We will look for your test cases in your Jira project, the same place you
created your Test Plan.
