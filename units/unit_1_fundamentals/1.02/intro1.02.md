## **DM Labs: Help From A Peer**

After a rough first day,
<a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_student_assignments/personas/Jordan.html">Jordan</a>,
an experienced QA Engineer is brought over to help start your “real” on the job
training, as they call it.

### The “Test Process” and "**QA Tools**"

1. **Planning** & **Test Plans**
2. Testing & **Test Cases**
3. **Reporting** & **Bug Reports** & **Test Summary Report**
4. Follow Up

Now that you know the testing flow, you need to REALLY get started.

**Using Requirements** you’ll identify **Criteria**. These include **Entry and
Exit Criteria** that will let you know if you’re even ready to test, and **Test
Criteria** that show whether or not your application is ready to deliver.
**Session Based Testing** will help you take those criteria and look them over
efficiently. If you do find problems, try to do some **Root Cause Analysis**,
but report them regardless using effective **Co-worker Communication**.
