### Summary

This is where the rubber meets the road, it's time to dig down and start
testing!

## Setup

Have each of the following handy:

- Your project in Jira
- Documentation
- The application
- Any notes taken during reviews

## Step 1

Follow the test process! You should have most if not all of the planning done
already, but don't be afraid to adjust if reality didn't match expectations.

## Step 2

Make sure you're taking notes of potential problems or questions you have. The
next phase will be to review your testing so far with your peers.
