### Summary

For this phase of your Fundamentals Project you should get together a solid test
plan.

## Setup

- Find your project in
  <a href="https://dmutah.atlassian.net" target="\_blank">Jira</a>, "{your key}
  Track Your Job Application".
- Open the "Track Your Job Application"
  <a href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_student_assignments/assets/tyja_docs.html" target="\_blank">documentation</a>.

## Step 1

Quickly review the requirements:

- In the document.
- In any tasks in Jira.

## Step 2

Execute test planning! Be ready to review a rough test plan with a small group
of peers.

- All work should be accomplished using your "Track Your Job Application"
  project in Jira.
- Your project is private; you and the instruction team are the only ones with
  access.
  - Copy/paste or screenshares will be your best source of peer reviews.
