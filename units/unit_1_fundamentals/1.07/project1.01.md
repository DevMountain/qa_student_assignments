# Fundamentals Project - Kickoff

### Summary

For this project, you will be undertaking the entire test process, from planning
your testing to submitting your report. This project is to be executed alone,
though discussion and peer review are encouraged. The application you are to
test will be assigned to you.

## Phases

### 1. Test Plan

In this phase, you are to review both the application and documentation to which
you have access, and create a Test Plan in Jira.

- Include all pertinent details to testing, taking care to be extra thorough
  about things like your criteria, or possible risks.
- Identify areas of the application you expect to use different design
  techniques for, as you should use each of the following in some form at least
  once:
  1. Equivalence Partitioning
  1. Boundary Value Analysis
  1. State Transition Diagrams/Tables
  1. Decision Rules

### 2. Plan Review

In small groups, you will review your test plan, and compare and contrast it
with your group members. Be prepared to explain your decisions, offer advice to
others, and incorporate their suggestions into your own plan.

### 3. Testing

Testing is in and of itself a process, and so this phase will be fairly
cyclical, with testing iterations, review periods, and additional testing
periods. During each review, a small group will discuss together their testing
so far, including a summary report. Each iteration is an opportunity to approach
your testing fresh with new ideas, or possibly with additional guidance.

- Testing Iteration 1
- Iteration 1 Review
- Testing Iteration 2
- Iteration 2 Review

### 4. Wrap-up

In this phase, you'll have the opportunity to apply any feedback from your final
group review, as well as findings from your own review processes. This might be:

- Covering any newly discovered risks.
- Fixing and re-executing existing tests.
- Updating traceability.
- Finalizing your test summary report.
- Etc.

### 5. Self-Retrospective

You will be given an outline to follow and questions to answer about your
experience with the project. This will help you to do a little bit of
performance evaluation, but is meant even more to encourage you see your growth
and how the skills you have learned will help you in the job industry.

### 6. Presentations

Each student will have a few minutes where they are required to share some of
the highlights of their testing, as well as a few points from their
self-retrospective.

## Submission

There will be multiple submissions required in Canvas, and each will have
instructions and a detailed rubric.

- Your project itself will live in Jira, and your final submission for this
  project will be only a link to your test plan.
- Correct use of issues in Jira and traceability on your part will allow
  instructors full access to your projects for grading and feedback.
