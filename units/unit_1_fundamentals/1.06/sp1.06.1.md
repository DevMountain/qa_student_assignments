# Hold Effective Discussions in the Best Place

## Skills Practice Summary

We need totalk to a lot of people about a lot of thigns to do our jobs
correctly. However, we work with a lot of busy people, and it's important to
make sure that we're taking care of things in the best context and not wasting
other team members' time.

## Step 1

Given the following set of problems or discussions, and possible venues for them
to be resolved, match each with its best option.

**Problem/Discussion**

1. We have prioritized tasks above their dependencies - like locking edits to
   unauthorized users before having a database to store user credentials.
2. There is one task that is likely to take more than one iteration by itself to
   complete.
3. You've spotted a typo in a page header.
4. You have a change to demo for your users before they start acceptance
   testing.
5. Our team has found that it gets tasks completed faster if each person working
   on it lets the next assignee know when it is their turn.
   - i.e. The designer tells the developers when design is complete, developers
     let their pers know when it's up for a code review, and then lets QA know
     when the review is done and there is a new build for testing, etc.
6. You have a few too many tasks on your plate to test and could use some help.

**Venue Options**

- A. Stand Up
- B. Planning
- C. Grooming
- D. Retrospective
- E. Pilot Support
- F. Ad Hoc (Stop by their desk)

## Solution

Compare your results to the following:

<details> <summary> Solution... </summary>

1. B
   - Planning meetings are all about determining and prioritizing work to be
     done.
2. C
   - A key function of grooming meetings is to take required work and break it
     down into smaller pieces that can be accomplished more quickly and
     efficiently.
3. F
   - Bugs found shouldn't wait for an official meeting, and stopping by a
     developer's desk to ask about a possible bug is often a great idea _before_
     reporting a bug.
4. E
   - Sometimes working with customers means phone calls, screen shares, and
     emails throughout the week. Something like a demo that will impact a group
     of customers, however, is usually best saved for a meeting like your piot
     support calls, the better to keep everyone on the same page.
     - It's easier to explain something once, than to explain the same thing and
       answer the same questions 5 times.
5. D
   - The purpose of a retrospective is to identify improvements; things that
     have gone well that should persist across future iterations/projects, or
     things that went poorly that we can improve on in the future.
6. A
   - Standup meetings are where we can discuss what we've done, what we plan to
     do, and roadblocks we need help overcoming. It's a great venue to ask for
     help if we need it to keep up with testing - quality belongs to the whole
     team after all.
