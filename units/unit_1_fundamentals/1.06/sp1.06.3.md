# Search for Answers

## Skills Practice Summary

The goal of this practic is not to directly improve a specific aspect of your
software testing. Instead, it's to enable you to better find answers to your own
questions about software and software testing.

## Step 1

Consider the general question:

> How can I write manual tests so that they are easier to automate?

Where could we go for answers?

- Stack Overflow is great resource for general software related questions, or
  tool specific questions.
- Medium and Quora also both have strong followings and either provide good
  tutorials or links to tutorials.
- Generally, Goole can beat all other options, since it includes resuls from
  almost all of them.

Find what you feel is a good answer to the question above by searchinghe
internet using the resources above, or another that you have found.

A google search for:

> how do I write manual tests to make them easy to automate

led me to a blog post that comes at it from a different direction but gives a
good guide:

- <a

  href="https://testsigma.com/blog/how-to-convert-manual-test-cases-into-automated-test-cases-and-why/">How
  to Convert Manual Test Cases into Automated Test Cases and Why?</a> By
  `testsigma`'s Mohammad Adil

It discusses how to convert manual tests, but part of that talks about wha they
consider to be the ideal manual test case design to make it easier.

## Step 2

Consider the tool specific question:

> How do I use Epic Links in Jira?

You can find answers in the same places we listed for Step 1; but when you're
going tool specific, it's often good to go straight into the documentation for
that tool.

Find an answer for this question by looking in the
<a target="\_blank" href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/resources/">official
Jira docs</a>.

A simple search for:

> How do I use Epic Links?

yields a number of good results.

- Remember sometimes it's good to start high level, to make sure you understand
  what you're asking first.
  - Do you understand epics and why we use them? Without that foundation, you
    many not understand the result.
