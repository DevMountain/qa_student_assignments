## **DM Labs: Bigger Picture**

With many of the more urgent needs of your application addressed, you have time
to try **Decision Rule Testing**. After a bit of practice, you realize all of
these new techniques only highlight your need for effective **Test
Maintenance**.

As you’re working on updating your existing testing to fit your new level of
skill and understanding, your project manager, [Mike](../../../personas/Mike.md)
drops in. With the crunch time around this last delivery, your training hasn’t
been maintained quite so well as it should have been. You know him from the
**Meetings** you've been attending, and he first explains _why_ you've been
having those, and a few other meetings that will be coming up as new projects
begin and more iterations pass by.

- **Standup**
- **Planning**
- **Grooming**
- **Retrospective**

Mike applauds your efforts, the improvements that you’ve made. The company will
be training you on **Other Technologies**, and he thinks you’ll be able to step
in ahead faster than [Alex](../../../personas/Alex.md) (your Lead QA) had
planned! You’ll be learning things like:

- API Testing
- Performance Testing
- **Test Automation**
