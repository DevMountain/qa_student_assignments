</details>

## Step 1

1. Find the project "{your name} Home Loan Wizard" in Jira.
   - There is only one task currently in this project, which contains
     documentation on how the system under test is supposed to know how to
     handle the application.
1. Review the documentation.
1. Create a table documenting the decision rules for the system, and attach it
   to a new test cases in the Jira project.

## Step 2

Create one or two tests that walk the tester through using your decision rules
to test

- Positively (making sure they work as expected) or
- Negatively (trying to break the rules)

## Submit

Submit the assignment in Canvas by submitting a link to the test case containing
your decision rules.

## Stretch

Try documenting these tests different ways:

- Different tests for different subsets of the rules
- A few specific tests, and more generic tests
- Extra attention given to negive testing

Do you find that there are certain ways of using decision rules you prefer? Or
are there reasons you are not a fan of the design technique?

You can also test the application in question,
