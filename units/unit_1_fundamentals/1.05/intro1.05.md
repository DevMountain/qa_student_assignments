## **DM Labs: Increasing Coverage**

Following the advice of your mentors

and
<a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_student_assignments/personas/Rosalie.html">Rosalie</a>),
you've been able to help your team catch up. Now, it’s time to do some **Risk
Analysis** to see where you can best improve **Test Coverage** of your
application. This’ll be one of the first steps to **Improving Processes** for
your team; the better to improve the quality of your deliverables.

- **Organizing Tests** will let you identify holes in coverage.
  - **Traceability** will make sure your requirements and tests are linked, and
    so are your bugs and tests, the better to keep everyone informed and on
    task.
  - **Identifying Dependencies** will enable more efficient testing, so that you
    aren’t trying to do things out of order or check them before they’re ready.

Your team’s lead developer,
<a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_student_assignments/personas/Jackie.html">Jackie</a>
pulls you aside to let you know that you’re working with one hand tied behind
your back: he explains to you the **Layers of Testing**. The whole team owns the
quality of your product after all, and testing can be done at every layer.

- **Structural Testing** is what we call tests based on the technical parts of
  building the app.
  - **Code Reviews** are really helpful. Usually they’re covered by the
    developers, but you can watch them, read comments, and know what the teams
    are working on, what problems they’ve already solved, that sort of thing.
  - **Unit Tests** are built into the application to test the smallest pieces of
    code, to make sure they work just as designed.

overhears and agrees, showing you where you've ended up with double coverage.
Knowing that, you can slim down some of your manual testing to just a few broad
regression tests in those areas. That frees you up to focus on **Detailed
Tests** around the changes being made, and Jordan shows you a few test design
techniques to help out in that regard.

- **Equivalence Partitioning** is apparently a good place to get started with
  new tests.
- If you have time, **Boundary Testing** will provide even more effective
  coverage.
