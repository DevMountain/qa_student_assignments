# Deliverable: Test Work Products

## Deliverable Summary

Essentially, you're being asked by the Labs team to show your work thus far.
They know there's a lot of progress to be made on Employee Manager, so they want
to be confident that they're making strides in the _right_ direction. _That_
means they need you keeping an eye on quality the whole way through.

By the end of the work day, you are to share a link to your Employee Manager
testing that you have undertaken thus far.

## Setup

- Open your "Devmountain Labs" project in Jira.
- Open the latest requirements for your team's project,
  <a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.2_README.html">Employee
  Manager v1.2</a>

## Acceptance Criteria

Your team and leaders will be satisfied if you can deliver the following:

1. A clear test plan.
   - For each feature to be tested:
     - Include the link(s) to the test(s) covering the area.
   - Brainstorm some potential risks to the quality of the application, and
     include these, as well as your estimated level of risk.
1. A set of test cases covering the app's functionality.
   - One or more of your tests needs to use equivalence partitioning or boundary
     value analysis.
1. Bugs you have found in your testing, linked to bugs that will serve for
   confirmation testing.
1. A test summary report detailing your testing thus far, and your opinion of
   the application.
   - Attach to your test plan, or as part of the test summary field, a state
     transition diagram with color coding indicating the "status" of that part
     of the application.

### Housekeeping

We've been using this project to show examples of how to accomplish the
different things we've learned, framed as "on the job training" with Devmountain
Labs.

- You _can_ use existing work as part of this project.
  - Know that your work _does_ need to be updated for the most recent version of
    the app, AND according to the other acceptance criteria.
- This is work that needs to be accomplished on your own, though you can still
  ask your instruction team questions.
  - All requirements have been covered, you are welcome to review prior skills
    practices, topics covered, etc.
