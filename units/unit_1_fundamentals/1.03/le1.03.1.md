## Summary

Now that you're aware of just what acceptance criteria are, look back at your
last lab exercise, the project "Flashcards".

It should be apparent that the requirements you were given were almost purely
functional; which makes sense when your requirements are all development tasks.
It's time to include acceptance criteria, and update your results accordingly.

<details> <summary> <strong> For Your Review </strong> </summary>

If you're feeling uncertain on where to start in this project, look over the
following:

- Skills Practice:
  - [Communicate With Customers](./sp1.03.1.html)
  - [Update Tests fo Acceptance Criteria](./sp1.03.2.html)
  - [Sell a Solution](./sp1.03.3.html)

</details>

## Step 1

1. Find the project "{your name} Flashcards" in Jira.
   - Remember, the tasks in Jira are serving AS your documentation.
1. Update your test plan and tests for the following list of acceptance
   criteria.
   - Feel free to update the list with accptance criteria you determined
     yourself; consider user needs.
   - **Note:** While this is good practice, you _shouldn't_ update requirements
     for your testing like this without discussing them with your project
     management team in the workplace.

### Acceptance Criteria

- As a user, I should be able to sign up for a new account.
- As a user, I should be able to manage my profile easily.
- As a user, I should be able to find flashcards easily.
- As a user, the flashcards should be intuitive to add, update, and review.
- As a user, I should find the performance acceptable, and the appearance
  adequate.

## Step 2

1. With the new acceptance criteria and updated testing, _test_.
1. Update existing bug reports or add new ones.
1. Add a new section to the "Testing Summary" in your test plan and add comments
   about how your assessment of the application has changed.
   - Just hit enter a few times and put in something like
     `Update {Today's Date}:`

## Submit

Mark this assignment complete in Canvas.

## Stretch

Consider how easy or hard it was to update your tests in this situation.

- Narrow or focused tests are often harder to update, and there are frequently
  more of them.
- Broader tests are usually easier to update/maintain, but often lack required
  details.

How can you adjust your own personal style of tests for easier maintenance in
the future?

- Update the tests cases you've created in Jira thus far to be easier to
  maintain.
