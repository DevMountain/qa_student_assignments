## **DM Labs: Surprise Meeting**

Surprise! You’ve got a meeting on your calendar, it’s time for you to provide
**Pilot Support** to real life customers.

- You’ve been asked to get ready for **Reporting Changes**, to let the users
  know what you’ve been working on.

The customers have run into several problems with the usability of the
application. The product owner [Rosalie](../../../personas/rosalie.html) on the
call with you assures them that your team will be working on:

- **Non-Functional Testing**, including **Usability Testing**.

For now though, it’s time to make sure that you understand their **Acceptance
Criteria** so that your app won’t just work as designed, but how they need it
to.

- Your notes from the call will become a form of **Unofficial Documentation**.

Updating your test plan, you’ll need to **Get Buy-In** from your product owner,
and then **Follow-up** with the customers using effective **Customer
Communication**.
