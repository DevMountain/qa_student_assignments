# Sell a Solution

## Skills Practice Summary

Getting buy in for a solution is TOUGH! So, it's time to practice.

## Setup

- Have the application requirements handy:
  [Employee Manager v1.1 Requirements](https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.1_README.html).
- Skim the email from the customer in [Skills Practice 1.03.1](./sp1.03.1.html).
- If you have updated tests from [Skills Practice 1.03.2](./sp1.03.2.html) have
  those handy.

## Step 1

Your team is in a bit of a bind. Without QA for too long (possibly without a
competent QA for even longer) you're playing catchup, with a frustrated cusotmer
to boot.

Consider the following questions:

- Does the current application planning cover the needs of the customer?
- Is your testing as presently constituted "good enough" to make sure that your
  customer is taken care of?
- Do you actually have enough information to answer those questions?
  - If no, who would you talk to, and what would you ask?

## Step 2

It's not unusual for customers to expect to receive a million dollar application
for the cost of a few thousand dollars.

- They frequently ask for more than they agreed to.
- Sometimes they have a point (common sense is real, we need to apply it too).

Your leaders have determined they need to do more research before committing to
any specific changes to the current project plan.

**_YOU_** have been tasked with explaining the pilot process to the customer;
something that _probably_ happened before, but you can follow up on it. The
project manager asks that you:

- Contact the customer ahead of each delivery to let them know:
  - What bugs have been fixed (if any), which they can confirm at their leisure
  - Which features have been added (if any), which they are asked to do their
    own acceptance testing upon
- Give them an opportunity to report bugs to you:
  - You can confirm if a bug has already been reported
  - If the bug they are reporting has already been fixed (or is being worked on)
  - If a bug they are reporting needs additional review

### **Practice doing so in one of the following ways:**

- With another person pretending to be the customer
  - In person
  - Via video chat
  - Over the phone
- With the facing camera on your laptop/smartphone/etc.
- In the mirror

Do the highest item on the list that you can. Yes it can be awkward, but you can
do it!

## Stretch

- Write a follow up email hitting the "high points" from your role played
  conversation with your customer.

## Solution

You have an example bug in your project.

- Title starts with **\*Solution\***
- Its status is **Done**
- Issue type is **Bug**

## **_Good work!_**
