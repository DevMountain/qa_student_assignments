# Effective Customer Communications

#### Target Time Limit: +/- 60 minutes

## Summary

Your customer _had_ been anxiously awaiting the delivery of your latest version
of your product. They were given the same version of "Flashcards" at you have
been testing.

Consider what they might think of it?

If you're feeling uncertain on where to start in this project, look over the
following:

- Skills Practice:
  - [Communicate With Customers](./sp1.03.1.html)
  - [Update Tests fo Acceptance Criteria](./sp1.03.2.html)
  - [Sell a Solution](./sp1.03.3.html)

## Step 1

1. Create a simple to read list of problems your customer may be concerned about
   in their review of your delivery.
   - Customers WILL review your delieveries in detail.
1. Make sure to avoid using too much lingo - most customers won't have the
   context to understand ticket numbers or simplified bug report titles; make
   your list accessible.

## Step 2

1. Look over your list of issues, and prioritize the list for what you feel
   needs to be fixed first.
1. As if you were emailing the customer directly write up a message including
   the following:
   - An acknowledgement of the problems, and a promise to work for your
     customer's satisfaction.
   - Your list, and an explanation of why you prioritized it the way you did.
   - Your plan for keeping in touch with the customr.
   - A request for their feedback on your plan, and any issues you may have
     missed.

## Submit

Submit your writeup in Canvas as text, or as a file.

## Stretch

Customers will frequently use opportunities like this to sneak in additional
features or desired changes. It's not that they're necessarily trying to get
something for nothing, it's natural; we do the same thing sometimes submitting
reviews in the app store, wanting new features, etc.

Identify what sorts of features you think your customer might ask for in a
situation like this.

- Should you go along with it and promise them the new items?
- Why or why not?
