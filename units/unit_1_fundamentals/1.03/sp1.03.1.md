# Communicate With Customers

## Skills Practice Summary

It can be touch to work with customers, let alone to work well with them.

## Setup

- Review the following customer communication - you may get something like it
  via email, a phone call, a chat message, etc.

> Hi there, I wanted to send you a message because I had some concerns, and I
> wanted to make sure they got to you. You app is a long way from done. I'm
> honestly disappointed in your team for delivering souch a rough product. Not
> only were the bugs HUGE, but there were WAY TOO MANY of them, and you missed a
> few of the big things that we asked for. **BUGS**
>
> 1. No validation on phone numbers
> 2. No validation anywhere
> 3. It's saving all edits, whether or not I hit save
>
> **Missed Requirements**
>
> - No "view only" accounts
> - No Search options
>
> I'm worried about my organization's future with yours at this point.
>
> Sincerely, Mr. Payne

## Step 1

Write up a response! As you do so...

- Consider their feelings. Yes, it's about feelings.
- Remember the points we talked about earlier
  - Avoid jargon
  - Stay professional
  - Don't throw _anyone_ under the bus
  - Be careful making commitments

With all that under consideration do/answer the following:

- Address their concerns directly
- Are there points they may have misunderstood or missed?
- How do we get back to a happy place?

There is no one "right" answer for this email, some might be brief, some might
be longer, the biggest thing is that your customer knows they were heard.

> Dear Mr. Payne, I'm grateful to you for writing back so promptly with your
> concerns. It's our goal to deliver a quality product to you and your team, and
> your feedback is invaluable. As it so happens, we have several of the issues
> you've brought up already on our roadmap. I'll talk with Rosalie to make sure
> that we're on the same page for this sort of thing faster in the future.
>
> 1. No validation on phone numbers:
>    - We have a task coming up in a future sprint to work on that specific
>      issue, we're just determining the most efficient way to get it done for
>      you.
> 2. No validation anywhere:
>    - The validation certainly isn't working the way that it should; this early
>      prototype wasn't made with that in mind, and I'm so sorry we
>      miscommunicated that intent with you, but we're actually working on
>      validation as we speak.
> 3. Saving all edits without clicking save:
>    - I noticed that same problem and logged a bug with our development team,
>      so we'll be working on that shortly.
>
> - No 'Search' options
>   - Like the validation, this is on our roadmap, and should be added soon!
> - No 'view only' accounts
>   - I'll have to do some research here and get back with you; I'll talk to
>     Rosalie and follow up.
>
> I understand having concerns, but we appreciate the relationship we've built
> up with you, and want to make sure that we meet or exceed your needs. I'm
> happy to jump on a call and talk through any remaining problems, or do so
> here, and copied Rosalie on the email. For now, look forward to the upcoming
> delivery which will address a good amount of these issues! Thanks, AJ Larson

## Stretch

Do any of these customer's complaints line up with what you've run into? Where
do their claims differ from the requirements you have?

- Write up a new message to your product owner:
  - Include pertinent details of mismatches with requirements
  - Include whether or not you think their ask is reasonable
  - Make suggestions how/when you could address the concern

## **_Good work!_**
