# State Transition Diagram and Tests

#### Target Time Limit: +/- 60 minutes

## Summary

To test out a different approach to testing a similar application, you'll be
diagramming states and transitions that you will then use as the basis for
designing/creating tests.

If you're feeling uncertain on where to start in this project, look over the
following:

- Skills Practice:
  - [Use the Right Criteria](./sp1.04.1.md)
  - [Streamline Down to Regression Testing](./sp1.04.2.md)
  - [Leverage State Transition Testing](./sp1.04.3.md)

</details>

## Step 1

1. Find the project "assetNeeded" in Jira.
   - You'll notice the project is empty. The project is just here as a separate
     home for your test cases.
1. Click around the application [assetNeeded](./assetNeeded.html) enough to have
   a rough idea of its states and triggering transitions.
1. Create a State Transition Diagram, and match it with a State Transition
   Table.
   - If you wanted to, try breaking things down into more than one diagram to
     cover multiple workflows.

## Step 2

1. Attach a screenshot/photo/upload of the diagram(s) and table(s) to a new test
   in the Jira Project.
1. Create a set of tests that test the application based upon your diagram(s)
   and table(s).

## Submit

Submit a link to the test containing your diagram(s) and table(s) to complete
this assignment in Canvas.

## Stretch

- Execute your tests and report the bugs you've found in your Jira project.
- Use that experience to further refine your diagram(s)/table(s)/test(s) - there
  are probably areas you weren't detailed enough, you focused too much, or you
  missed completely.

- You can also try this out on a completely different system!
