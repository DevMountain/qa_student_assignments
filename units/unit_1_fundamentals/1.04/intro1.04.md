## **DM Labs: Soft Skills**

You get into work to find an email from
<a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_student_assignments/personas/Rosalie.html">Rosalie</a>,
your team’s product owner. It’s time to exercise your **Soft Skills**! Your
project manager is on board as well, it's time for you to build up your
credibility with your team:

- Today you’ll be **Delivering Bad News** to your team.

Knowing that you suffer from **Imposter Syndrome**, Rosalie tells you that she
used to be in QA herself, and the best thing to do is just give it a shot. You
won't always be perfect, and it’s important to practice **Learning From
Mistakes**.

Ahead of your meeting, you brainstorm and talk to
<a target="\_blank" href="https://devmountain.github.io/qa_student_assignments/personas/Alex.html">Alex</a>
about some ideas on how you can clean up processes and help your team.

- **Handling Bugs** will be important - several bugs have been reported in the
  past and have since been sitting still.
  - Existing bugs need to have **Confirmation Testing**.
  - You need **Regression Testing** to validate existing functionality.
- It’s time to expand your coverage and work to **Create Tests** while **Using
  Criteria** and **Test Design Techniques**.
  - **Broad Tests** are all you’ll have time for right now.
  - **State Transition Diagrams** can help to keep you organized and when
    **Estimating Work**.
