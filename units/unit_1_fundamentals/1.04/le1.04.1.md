# Confirmation and Regression Tests

#### Target Time Limit: +/- 60 minutes

## Summary

You've been asked to step in and assist a team that hasn't had QA for quite some
time. They're pretty confident about where things stand right now, BUT they're
conerned about:

- Fixing bugs correctly.
- Making sure that their fixes don't break anything else.

## Step 1

1. Look for the project "{your name} Todo" in Jira. You'll see there are several
   bugs and a few tasks in the project, to fix a few problems and bring the
   application up to date.
1. Review these tasks, and spend a few minutes clicking around the application:
   [Todos](https://devmountain.github.io/qa_todos)

## Step 2

Create tests to verify the bug fixes, AKA confirmation tests.

## Step 3

Create regression tests that will verify that already working functionality
continues to work after the fixes and changes are made.

## Submit

Submit a link in Canvas to one of your tests when you are done.

## Stretch

Consider one of your favorite applications.

- Spend a few minutes outlining regression tests for the application from
  memory.
- Review your outlines against the application itself.

It can be easy to forget details or assume steps for the apps we are familiar
with, which what makes regression testing so important.

- Complete one or two fully fleshed out regression tests against the app
  selected above.
- Share them with a friend or peer, seek their feedback.
