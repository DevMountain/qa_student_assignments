### Bio

Jordan had been part of the organization for a little over a year, though he's
worked QA jobs before. He knows how he likes to test and has little patience for
wasting time, especially when trying to improve processes past the point of
diminishing returns.

### Role - QA Engineer

- Responsible for planning and executing testing for a development team.
- Maintains and creates automated regression tests for their portion of the
  product.
- Reports to:
  - **Project Manager** or **Scrum Master**- for the day to day development work
  - **Lead QA/QA Manager** or **Project Manager/Scrum Master** - for
    organization level initiatives, HR purposes, etc.
    - Usually you'll have a lead QA or QA manager, though sometimes in smaller
      organizations QA will sometimes JUST report to their dev leadership.
