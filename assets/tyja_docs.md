# Track Your Job Application <img src="./tyja.png">

## Purpose

Have you ever struggled while on the hunt for a job? It's discouraging enough to
miss out on opportunities you've worked hard for. It's even worse to realize
that you cost yourself an chance because you've forgotten about key dates,
misplaced contact information, or lost track of where you were in the
application process.

## MVP

Users should be able to

- Create an account and log in.
- Create/Edit/Delete jobs, action items, contacts.

## Testing Environment

There is a staging environment for testing ahead of delivery to customers. It is
safe to add/edit/delete test data. Be aware that other developers/testers may be
using the same database.
